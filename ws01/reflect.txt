1. Do you have any previous programming experience? If so, what language(s)? If not, what are your initial thoughts about the C language and this course?

Although I don’t have any programming experience, I’m keen on learning it. I believe the Programming language C is a substructure for learning other languages. It is illustrating how a computer thinks.



2. Describe your understanding of the compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program.
In my opinion, compiling is like translating readable English sentences into machine language. It executes at different levels; syntax plays the rule of grammar, and compilers like VS Code play the rule of Google Translate!



3. What do you hope to achieve in this course? Describe your goals and expectations.

I'm looking forward to learning all the materials required to be a game programmer. 
My final goal is to be able to make a world of my own with the rules that i determine 
and improve it every day in a way that others can feel the same freedom and happiness as i will.
