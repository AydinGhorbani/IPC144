1) In some lines of code, we need to prompt the user for variables that are required to iterate in the loop, such as in a do-while loop, where we can prompt the user to enter the values first, and then the code will begin to iterate the functions.However, whatever we can do in a do-while loop, we can do it in a while loop, and while is better because it is easier to understand what is happening in the loop and when the loop should end.
For loop is easier than the others because we have condition, flag, and counter in one line, so you don't have to browse inside the loop in order to do a walkthrough, but there is one drawback to "For" loop. It's a little bit harder to work with when we have lots of "if" statements inside the loop. For example, when I wanted to find out if 'y' existed in the array or not, I wanted to set the counter after a specific if condition, and it was a little bit hard for me to find where the counter would update.

2) It's easy to test and debug syntactic problems because the compiler will put a red or yellow line under the problem, and I can fix the problem if I know the correct syntax or I search online to find the correct syntax. But semantic errors are tricky; for this workshop to find the correct logics for operations and flags for loops, I created another sheet in the VS code, so there is no need to go through all the programme to test it.
To find the correct operations for year and month, first I checked the output and did some operations on my phone's calculator to understand what was going on, then I tried to put everything I did in my phone into VS Code. It was not very tricky because in previous workshops we did the roundup and used the correct variables to store the data.
Overall, testing and debugging are not too hard if you know what you're doing in the code.
